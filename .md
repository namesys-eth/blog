# From Numbers to Names: History of Nameservices

Imagine addressing someone by their phone number rather than their name. That's what the internet would be like without naming services. Naming services make the internet more user-friendly and accessible by providing a convenient way to translate human-readable names into machine-readable identifiers. Without a naming service, navigating the internet would become much more difficult. You'd have to remember and manually enter long strings of numbers (like IP addresses) instead of using simple and memorable names. 

But how did we get here? What was the first-ever naming service?  Is it important to have a Web3 name? Let’s explore these questions to understand the evolution of naming services and their significance.

## Namecoin: The OG of Decentralized Naming (2011)

There are over 1000 altcoins out there, but only a few have made a lasting impact. One such cryptocurrency is Namecoin. Namecoin is one of the earliest cryptocurrencies, launched in April 2011. It was created by an anonymous developer known by the pseudonym "Vinced." Namecoin is based on Bitcoin's codebase with modifications to support the decentralized registration and management of domain names. It uses a proof-of-work algorithm and like Bitcoin, Namecoin has 21 million coins in circulation.

In 2010, the concept of creating a tokenized domain name system was initially proposed in an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) room called #bitcoin-dev. Participants began discussing the idea of developing a system similar to Bitcoin but tailored for domain names, which they named "bitdns." Then, in April 2011, Vincent Durham introduced Namecoin on the same website where Bitcoin was first announced. This new system allowed for registering domain names in a decentralized way, similar to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin transactions.

From Namecoin’s official website: “Namecoin is an experimental open-source technology which improves decentralization, security, censorship resistance, privacy, and speed of certain components of the Internet infrastructure such as DNS and identities.” While it may not be as popular as other cryptocurrencies in terms of value, Namecoin is special because it focuses on decentralizing the way we name things on the internet. 

Namecoin and Bitcoin, though sharing a common codebase and some fundamental features, differ significantly in their purpose, protocol rules, and utility. Bitcoin was conceived as a decentralized digital currency, providing an alternative to traditional fiat currencies and facilitating peer-to-peer financial transactions. In contrast, Namecoin was designed to create a decentralized domain name system (DNS) on the blockchain, enabling censorship-resistant registration and management of domain names.

Namecoin maintained a small but dedicated community of supporters and developers who believed in its vision of a decentralized domain name system. Namecoin's market performance has been modest compared to other cryptocurrencies. Its value and market capitalization have fluctuated over time, influenced by factors such as market sentiment, adoption, and technological developments. While Namecoin may not have achieved widespread adoption, it remains an important project in the history of cryptocurrency. 

## List of decentralized naming services across various blockchain ecosystems:

After Namecoin, several other nameservices and domain name systems have been developed, each with its own unique features and purposes. Here are some additional decentralized naming services that have emerged post-Namecoin:

- Ethereum Name Service (ENS) (2017)
- Handshake (HNS) (2018)
- Unstoppable Domains (2018)
- Zilliqa Name Service (ZNS) (2019)
- KILT Protocol (2019)
- Neo Name Service (NNS) (2019)
- Handshake Domains (HNS) (2020)
- Kusama Name Service (KNS) (2020)
- Tron Name Service (TNS) (2020)
- Avalanche Name Service (ANS) (2021)
- Tezos Name Service (TNS) (2021)
- Polkadot Name Service (PNS) (2021)
- Solana Name Service (SNS) (2021)
- Theta Name Service (TNS) (2021)
- Arweave Name Service (ANS) (2021)

## Why Decentralized NameServices?

- **You Own Your Name**: Unlike traditional domain names (which you rent), these names are yours to keep, like a digital piece of property.
- **More Secure**: Blockchain technology makes them more resistant to hacking and censorship.
- **One Name for Everything**: Imagine using a single name to log in to different websites and applications.

We are still in the early stages of understanding the full potential of decentralized naming services, and many people may not yet grasp the significance of this emerging technology. But just as broadband and high-definition displays transformed our online experience, decentralized DNS promises the same. Securing your name is the first step towards embracing the opportunities and benefits offered by decentralized naming services. We might not fully see it yet, but one thing's for sure: they're here to stay. So, why not grab your favorite name and be a part of the future internet?
